# CPACharge

## A working mock up of a CPACharge member site

It is responsive, has many breakpoints, and is created using HTML/SCSS/Bootstrap/JS

## Potential To Do:

* **Responsive Navbar**
  * resizes as user scrolls on mobile
  * adjust toggle menu
* Animated computer image - fade in pieces
* Slow fade
* More quotes - carousel
